            Hair Cycle Solution.

          The 120-Day Refund Policy ensures that your satisfaction is our top

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>30-Day Return Window:</strong> If you decide to return the
            product without using it, you have 30 days from the date of
            receiving the item to request a return. The product must be in the
            same condition as received, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its
            original packaging. A valid receipt or proof of purchase is
            required.

          <li>
            <strong>120-Day Satisfaction Guarantee:</strong> Our commitment to
            your satisfaction goes beyond the initial 30 days. Once you start
            using the Nordic Biolabs Hair Regrowth Cap, Bio-Veloxin Serum, or
            Complete Hair Cycle Solution, we encourage you to give it a fair
            chance for a minimum of 120 days. If, after consistent use for 120
            days, you are not satisfied with the results, you can initiate a
            return for a full refund. We value your commitment to trying our
            products and want to ensure you feel confident about your purchase.
